"NMSLauncher" can be used to configure "No Man's Sky" before launch.

# Notes
This application is a quick hacky launcher that will let you edit the graphics settings of "No Man's Sky" before launching the game. Might be ideal for those who do not know how to edit the settings through the MXML file.

This is in no way a good implementation as it was wrote as a "quick fix" to just do the job.
If this does get some attention, a re-write may happen. Push requests are accepted for any custom changes. :)

Open solution in Visual Studio (2015 Community recommended)
